# Mortal Kombat Style Fighting Game

This project is a simple fighting game inspired by Mortal Kombat, created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's designed for beginners to learn the basics of game development and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the game canvas and includes the necessary scripts.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the game interface.
- `js/utils.js`: Utility functions used throughout the game.
- `js/classes.js`: The core of the game, where all the classes for sprites and fighters are defined.
- `index.js`: The main JavaScript file that initializes the game and handles the game loop.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to complete the code in the following files:

1. **`js/classes.js`**: Implement the `Sprite` and `Fighter` classes. This is where you will practice your OOP skills.
2. **`index.js`**: Write the game loop and handle player input.
3. **`js/utils.js`**: Implement the utility functions for collision detection and timers.

### Completing the Code

Follow the comments in the code to complete the game. The comments will guide you through the implementation of each feature.

## Running the Game

Once you have completed the code, you can run the game by opening the `index.html` file in your web browser.
